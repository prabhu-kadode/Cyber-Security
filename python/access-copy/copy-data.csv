If an interviewer says “we’re still interviewing other candidates at the moment,” and then walks you out into the lobby, does that mean they want to hire you potentially after or no?"

"Dhurandhar (transl. Stalwart) is a 2025 Indian Hindi-language spy action thriller film written, directed and co-produced by Aditya Dhar. Produced by Jyoti Deshpande, Aditya Dhar and Lokesh Dhar under the banners Jio Studios and B62 Studios, it stars Ranveer Singh, Akshaye Khanna, R. Madhavan, Arjun Rampal, Sanjay Dutt, Sara Arjun and Rakesh Bedi with Manav Gohil, Danish Pandor, Saumya Tandon, Gaurav Gera, and Naveen Kaushik in supporting roles.[5][6]"
"The film draws inspiration from real-life events involving geopolitical tensions and covert operations conducted by India's R&AW, particularly those associated with Operation Lyari, a Pakistan government-led crackdown on gangs and criminal syndicates in the Lyari area of Karachi.[7] With a runtime of 214 minutes, it is one of the longest Indian films ever made.["
"The first of a two-part series, Dhurandhar was released in theaters on 5 December 2025. It received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances of the ensemble cast (particularly Singh and Khanna), as well as the direction, cinematography, atmosphere, music and world-building, but criticized its runtime, pacing and perceived narrative inconsistencies.[8] A follow-up film, Dhurandhar Part 2, is scheduled to release on 19 March 2026.[9]"
