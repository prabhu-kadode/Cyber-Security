Three pillers of secuity are availablity, integrity and confidentiality

confidentiality is nothing but data should be safe and secure.
It should be acceesed by only those who are authorised.
Not everyone has access to it. 

integrity is nothing but data must be safe and not tempared during trainsit and at rest.
we can use various techniques to ensure data intrigrity during transit and at rest.
we can use hmac tech to encrypt data to protect it from getting tempred.

availablity is nothing but data must be available during any type of attack.
Those who have access to it must get data easily without any hustle

Encryption is process of converting text into unreadble format
with some secret key so that it can be protected and can't be read when it is caught by attacker.
We use various algoritham to do so.
We have symteric and asymetric encryption.
Systemtrck encryption is encrypting your data and decrypting it with same key
where as asymterick is nothing byt secret key is different.
